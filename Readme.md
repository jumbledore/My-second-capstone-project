#### Description of dataset

What is AdventureWorks dataset? AdventureWorks Database is a Microsoft product sample for an online transaction processing (OLTP) database. 
The AdventureWorks Database supports a fictitious, multinational manufacturing company called Adventure Works Cycles.

#### What you learned

I have learnt basic sql queries such as inner join to obtain information from database and to copy data to a csv format.

#### Edits made to raw data set

No edits were made to actual dataset but i compiled data from 5 tables from the original dataset into one table for the purpose of the assignment. Table name is called main_6.

#### Conclusions drawn from data
- Majority of customers are based in the US.
- Mountain and road bicycles are the top selling products.
- Many customers feedback that their purchase was due to the prices (goods are price elastic).
- The Company is increasing in revenue/sales year on year.
- Highest sales are in Q3.
